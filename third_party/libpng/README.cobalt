Description:
Our custom configuration options are defined in pngusr.h. This was previously
called mozpngconf.h, which was copied from Mozilla and modified by Apple (hence
the wk_* names) to produce the Chromium version.  This was then copied into
Cobalt.

For Cobalt, modified pngusr.h options to allow Skia to call into it for encoding
and decoding.
