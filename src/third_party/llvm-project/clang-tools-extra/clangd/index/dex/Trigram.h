// Trigrams are attributes of the symbol unqualified name used to effectively
// extract symbols which can be fuzzy-matched given user query from the inverted
// index. To match query with the extracted set of trigrams Q, the set of
// generated trigrams T for identifier (unqualified symbol name) should contain
// all items of Q, i.e. Q âŠ† T.
//
// Trigram sets extracted from unqualified name and from query are different:
// the set of query trigrams only contains consecutive sequences of three
// characters (which is only a subset of all trigrams generated for an
// identifier).

/// which can be jumped to during fuzzy matching. Each combination of such three
/// symbols is inserted into the result.

/// Trigrams can start at any character in the input. Then we can choose to move
