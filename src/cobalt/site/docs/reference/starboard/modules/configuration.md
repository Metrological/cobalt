title: "Starboard Module Reference: configuration.h"
---

Provides a description of the current platform in lurid detail so that
common code never needs to actually know what the current operating system
and architecture are.<br>
It is both very pragmatic and canonical in that if any application code
finds itself needing to make a platform decision, it should always define
a Starboard Configuration feature instead. This implies the continued
existence of very narrowly-defined configuration features, but it retains
porting control in Starboard.

<h3 id="sb_printf_format" class="small-h3">SB_PRINTF_FORMAT</h3>

Tells the compiler a function is using a printf-style format string.
`format_param` is the one-based index of the format string parameter;
`dots_param` is the one-based index of the "..." parameter.
For v*printf functions (which take a va_list), pass 0 for dots_param.

<h3 id="sb_release_candidate_api_version" class="small-h3">SB_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_API_VERSION</h3>

The next API version to be frozen, but is still subject to emergency

version, but be aware that small incompatible changes may still be made to
it.
The following will be uncommented when an API version is a release candidate.

certain optimizations because it knows the pointers are unique.
