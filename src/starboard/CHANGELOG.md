# Starboard Version Changelog

This document records all changes made to the Starboard interface, up to the
current version, but not including the experimental version.  This file will
be updated each time a new Starboard version is released.  Each section in
this file describes the changes made to the Starboard interface since the
version previous to it.

**NOTE: Starboard versions 3 and below are no longer supported.**

## Version 7

### `SbDecodeTargetInfoPlane` can specify color plane information

Previously: Planes of type `kSbDecodeTargetFormat2PlaneYUVNV12`
were assumed to have the luma mapped to the alpha channel (`GL_ALPHA`)
and the chroma mapped to blue and alpha (`GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA`). However,
some graphics systems require that luma is on `GL_RED_EXT` and the chroma
is on `GL_RG_EXT`.

## Version 6

### Named `SbStorageRecord`s

This extends the `SbStorage` interface with the ability to open named
`SbStorageRecord`s. Calling `SbStorageOpenRecord` and `SbStorageDeleteRecord`
with a `NULL` `name` parameter provides access to the old "default" record.

### Introduce pointer (mouse) input support

This extends the `SbInput` interface with some enum values and data members to
allow mouse, wheel, and more generic pointer input.

### Flexible audio specific config

`SbMediaAudioHeader::audio_specific_config` will be a pointer instead of an
array.

### Time Zone API Cleanup

Removes `SbTimeZoneGetDstName()` -- The Daylight Savings Time version of the
time zone.

Changes `SbTimeZoneGetName()` to be more flexible in what it is allowed to
return.

### `SbDecodeTargetNumberOfPlanesForFormat`

Adds the convenience inline function, SbDecodeTargetNumberOfPlanesForFormat() to
`starboard/decode_target.h`.

### Preload Support

Adds the `kSbEventTypePreload` event, and modifies the application state machine
to utilize it.

### Platform Error Cleanup

Removes `SbSystemPlatformErrorType` values specific to user status.

### `SbDecodeTarget` support for the UYVY (i.e. YUV 422) format

Add support for UYVY decode targets (e.g. YUV 422) via the
`kSbDecodeTargetFormat1PlaneUYVY` enum.

### Add More Remote Keys

This adds SbKey codes for:

  * Color keys
  * Closed Caption key
  * Application launch key
  * Channel Up/Down keys

### `kSbEventTypeLowMemory`

Adds a new event type -- `kSbEventTypeLowMemory` -- to allow a platform to
signal that the application may soon be terminated due to low memory
availability.

### Interface change to `SbPlayerWriteSample()`
`const` is added to `sample_buffers` and `sample_buffer_sizes` parameters.

### Support key status change
Add `key_statuses_changed_callback` parameter to `SbDrmCreateSystem()` to
support MediaKeySession::keyStatuses and MediaKeySession::onkeystatuseschange.

### Changes thumbstick direction

Change the meaning of negative values for thumbstick position from bottom
right to upper left.

## Version 5

### Add Speech Recognizer API
Introduce `starboard/speech_recognizer.h`.
This newly-introduced `starboard/speech_recognizer.h` adds the on-device speech
recognizer feature.

### Added new system property to allow platform-specific user agent suffixes
Adds `kSbSystemPropertyUserAgentAuxField` to the `SbSystemPropertyId` enum to
allow platform-specific User-Agent suffix.

### Remove unused enums from `starboard/input.h`
The following unused enum values are removed from `starboard/input.h`:
  * `kSbInputDeviceTypeMicrophone`
  * `kSbInputDeviceTypeSpeechCommand`
  * `kSbInputEventTypeAudio`
  * `kSbInputEventTypeCommand`
  * `kSbInputEventTypeGrab`
  * `kSbInputEventTypeUngrab`

## Version 4

### Decode-to-Texture Player Output Mode
Feature introducing support for decode-to-texture player output mode, and
runtime player output mode selection and detection.
In `starboard/configuration.h`,
  * `SB_IS_PLAYER_PUNCHED_OUT`, `SB_IS_PLAYER_PRODUCING_TEXTURE`, and
    `SB_IS_PLAYER_COMPOSITED` now no longer need to be defined (and should not
    be defined) by platforms.  Instead, these capabilities are detected at
    runtime via `SbPlayerOutputModeSupported()`.

In `starboard/player.h`,
  * The enum `SbPlayerOutputMode` is introduced.
  * `SbPlayerOutputModeSupported()` is introduced to let applications query
    for player output mode support.
  * `SbPlayerCreate()` now takes an additional parameter that specifies the
    desired output mode.
  * The punch out specific function `SbPlayerSetBounds()` must now be
    defined on all platforms, even if they don't support punch out (in which
    case they can implement a stub).
  * The function `SbPlayerGetCompositionHandle()` is removed.
  * The function `SbPlayerGetTextureId()` is replaced by the new
    `SbPlayerGetCurrentFrame()`, which returns a `SbDecodeTarget`.

In `starboard/decode_target.h`,
  * All get methods (`SbDecodeTargetGetPlane()` and `SbDecodeTargetGetFormat()`,
    `SbDecodeTargetIsOpaque()`) are now replaced with `SbDecodeTargetGetInfo()`.
  * The `SbDecodeTargetInfo` structure is introduced and is the return value
    type of `SbDecodeTargetGetInfo()`.
  * `SbDecdodeTargetCreate()` is now responsible for creating all its internal
    planes, and so its `planes` parameter is replaced by `width` and
    `height` parameters.
  * The GLES2 version of `SbDecdodeTargetCreate()` has its EGL types
    (`EGLDisplay`, `EGLContext`) replaced by `void*` types, so that
    `decode_target.h` can avoid #including EGL/GLES2 headers.
  * `SbDecodeTargetDestroy()` is renamed to `SbDecodeTargetRelease()`.

In `starboard/player.h`, `starboard/image.h` and `starboard/decode_target.h`,
  * Replace `SbDecodeTargetProvider` with
    `SbDecodeTargetGraphicsContextProvider`.
  * Instead of restricting Starboard implementations to only be able to run
    `SbDecodeTarget` creation and destruction code on the application's
    renderer's thread with the application's renderer's `EGLContext` current,
    Starboard implementations can now run arbitrary code on the application's
    renderer's thread with its `EGLContext` current.
  * Remove `SbDecodeTargetCreate()`, `SbDecodeTarget` creation is now an
    implementation detail to be dealt with in other Starboard API functions
    that create `SbDecodeTargets`, like `SbImageDecode()` or `SbPlayerCreate()`.

### Playback Rate
Support for setting the playback rate on an SbPlayer.  This allows for control
of the playback speed of video at runtime.

### Floating Point Input Vector
Change `input.h`'s `SbInputVector` structure to contain float members instead of
ints.

### Delete SbUserApplicationTokenResults
Deleted the vestigal struct `SbUserApplicationTokenResults` from `user.h`.

### Storage Options for Encoded Audio/Video Data
Enables the SbPlayer implementation to provide instructions to its user on
how to store audio/video data.  Encoded audio/video data is cached once being
demuxed and may occupy a significant amount of memory.  Enabling this feature
allows the SbPlayer implementation to have better control on where encoded
audio/video data is stored.

### Unified implementation of `SbMediaCanPlayMimeAndKeySystem()`
Use a unified implementation of `SbMediaCanPlayMimeAndKeySystem()` based on
`SbMediaIsSupported()`, `SbMediaIsAudioSupported()`, and
`SbMediaIsVideoSupported()`.

### Introduce `ticket` parameter to `SbDrmGenerateSessionUpdateRequest()`
Introduce `ticket` parameter to `SbDrmGenerateSessionUpdateRequest()`
and `SbDrmSessionUpdateRequestFunc` to allow distinguishing between callbacks
from multiple concurrent calls.

### Introduce `SbSocketGetInterfaceAddress()`
`SbSocketGetInterfaceAddress()` is introduced to let applications find out
which source IP address and the associated netmask will be used to connect to
the destination. This is very important for multi-homed devices, and for
certain conditions in IPv6.

### Introduce `starboard/cryptography.h`
In newly-introduced `starboard/cryptography.h`,
  * Optional support for accelerated cryptography, which can, in
    particular, be used for accelerating SSL.

### Introduce z-index parameter to `SbPlayerSetBounds()`
Allow `SbPlayerSetBounds` to use an extra parameter to indicate the z-index of
the video so multiple overlapping videos can be rendered.

### Media source buffer settings removed from `configuration.h`
Media source buffer settings in Starboard.

### Introduce `starboard/accessibility.h`
In particular, the functions `SbAccessibilityGetDisplaySettings()` and
`SbAccessibilityGetTextToSpeechSettings()` have now been introduced.

Additionally, a new Starboard event, `kSbEventTypeAccessiblitySettingsChanged`,
has been defined in `starboard/event.h`.

### HDR decode support
In `starboard/media.h`, `SbMediaColorMetadata` is now defined and it contains
HDR metadata. The field `SbMediaColorMetadata color_metadata` is now added to
`SbMediaVideoSampleInfo`.

### Add `kSbSystemDeviceTypeAndroidTV` to `starboard/system.h`
A new device type, `kSbSystemDeviceTypeAndroidTV`, is added to
starboard/system.h.

### Deprecate `SbSpeechSynthesisSetLanguage()`
SbSpeechSynthesisSetLanguage() has been deprecated.

### Request State Change Support
Added `SbSystemRequestPause()`, `SbSystemRequestUnpause()`,
`SbSystemRequestSuspend()`.

`SbSystemRequestSuspend()` in particular can be hooked into a platform's "hide"
or "minimize" window functionality.

### Font Directory Path Support
Added `kSbSystemPathFontDirectory` and `kSbSystemPathFontConfigurationDirectory`
which can be optionally specified for platforms that want to provide system
fonts to Starboard applications. The font and font configuration formats
supported are application-specific.

### Add `SB_NORETURN` to `starboard/configuration.h`.
Added attribute macro `SB_NORETURN` to allow functions to be marked as noreturn.

### Mark `SbSystemBreakIntoDebugger` `SB_NORETURN`.
Add `SB_NORETURN` to declaration of `SbSystemBreakIntoDebugger`, to allow it to
be used in a manner similar to `abort`.
