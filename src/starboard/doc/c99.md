# Starboard and C99

## Background

Historically Starboard did not allow usage of standard C symbols in order to
isolate Cobalt from non-compliant libc implementations and to provide a single,
consistent behavior at the Starboard API layer.

## C99 Usage Rationale
1. Inconsistencies in the libc libraries are rare and all third party libraries
need to be ported to the Starboard API. This can be a significant maintenance
cost as the dependencies need to be periodically rebased.

2. Even with all the efforts to use POEM headers from the
[starboard/client_porting](../../starboard/client_porting) directory many
non-Evergreen platforms still have a lot of direct system dependencies. These
dependencies do not exist for Evergreen platforms as Cobalt is statically
linked with the [musl](../../third_party/musl/musl.gyp) libc library.

3. Starting with Starboard 13 a limited set of C99 symbols will be allowed.
This set will expand gradually while the corresponding Starboard APIs will be
deprecated and eventually removed.
