# How To Use
A docker container will be launched that will update the cobalt.dev source files
in the Cobalt repository specified by the environment variable `COBALT_SRC` or
the current working directory, which should be the root of the Cobalt
repository, if that environment variable is not set.

When the `docsite` service is run, the container will then host the updated
cobalt.dev site locally on port `4000`.

When the `docsite-build-only` service is run, the container will build and
output the site content in the directory `out/deploy/www` at the root of the
Cobalt directory, and copy the app.yaml deployable into `out/deploy`.

# How To Run
docker-compose build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) SERVICE

docker-compose up SERVICE

# Notes

A separate docker-compose.yml was created due to the root docker-compose.yml
being unable to locate the Gemfile in the Docker build context.

The Gemfile was copied from third_party/repo-publishing-toolkit/Gemfile because
we need to run `bundle install` with elevated permissions but if we let the
`preview-site.sh`, which normally installs gems, run with elevated permissions
the resulting files added or modified would not be accessible to the user who
ran the Docker container.
